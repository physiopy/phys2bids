How to set up a heuristic file
==============================

This tutorial prepares an heuristic file to process general ``phys2bids`` inputs.

Anatomy of a heuristic file
---------------------------

Let's have a look under the hood of the heuristic files used in the `tutorial <howto.html>`_.
It's the file ``heur_tutorial.py`` in ``phys2bids/phys2bids/heuristics/``:

.. _heuristicfile:

.. literalinclude:: ../phys2bids/heuristics/heur_tutorial.py
   :linenos:

We can split this file into three parts: the initialisation, the dictionaries, and the functional code.

Initialisation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../phys2bids/heuristics/heur_tutorial.py
   :linenos:
   :lines: 1-43

It's important **not to modify this part of the file**. Instead, you can copy and paste it into your own heuristic file.

This file looks like a python function, initialised by a mandatory parameter, ``physinfo``.
| ``physinfo`` is the information used to label your file. **At the moment, it corresponds to the name of the input file itself**. This is what you need to build your heuristic.

The function initialises ``info``, a `python dictionary <https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp>`_ that contains the BIDS keys, such as `sub` and `ses`, as well as all the possible keys you can add to your heuristics. This is what you will work with in creating your heuristic.

The scripts also imports ``fnmatch``, a nice python module that lets you use bash-like wildcards.

Dictionaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../phys2bids/heuristics/heur_tutorial.py
   :linenos:
   :lines: 44-67
   :lineno-start: 44
   :dedent: 4

| This is the core of the function, and the part that should be adapted to process your files. In practice, it's a |statement|_.
| You need an ``if`` or ``elif`` statement for each file that you want to process, that will test if the ``physinfo`` is similar to a string (first case) or exactly matches a string (second case). The content of the statement is a set of `variable initialisations as a string <https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp>`_, with the only difference that you're populating a dictionary here. This means that instead of declaring something like ``var = 'something'``, you will declare something like ``info['var'] = 'something'``
| The list of possible keys is in the comment above, and corresponds to the list of possible entities of the `BIDs specification <https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/06-physiological-and-other-continuous-recordings.html>`_:

- ``task`` stands for the name of the task. **It's the only required entity**, and it should match the task of the neuroimaging file associated to the physiological data. If this is missing **the program will stop running**.
- ``run`` is the optional entity for the `index of the scan in a group of same modalities <https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/01-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data.html#the-run-entity>`_ (e.g. 2 resting states).
- ``rec`` is the optional entity for the `reconstruction algorithm <https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/01-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data.html#the-rec-entity>`_.
- ``acq`` is the optional entity for the `set of acquisition parameters <https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/01-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data.html#the-acq-entity>`_.
- ``dir`` is the optional entity for the phase encoding direction (see `here <https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/01-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data.html#task-including-resting-state-imaging-data>`_).

Note that one mandatory BIDs entity is missing: the **``sub`` entity**, correspondent to the subject label. This is because it has to be specified while calling ``phys2bids``, as it's explained in the tutorial section `"generating-outputs-in-bids-format" <howto.html#generating-outputs-in-bids-format>`_. The **session entity** can be specified in the same way. Moreover, if you have a **multifrequency file** there will be another entity, ``recording`` automatically added to those specified here, and containing the sample frequency of the different outputs.

Let's try to read the first statement in the example:

	*"If the name of the file (``physinfo``) contains the string ``'*tutorial*'``, then assign the entity ``task`` with value ``test``, the ``run`` as number ``00``, and the reconstruction used as ``labchart``"*

Note that we used only a subset of possible entities.

.. _statement: https://www.w3resource.com/python/python-if-else-statements.php

.. |statement| replace:: ``if .. elif .. else`` statement.

Functional code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../phys2bids/heuristics/heur_tutorial.py
   :linenos:
   :lines: 68-
   :lineno-start: 68
   :dedent: 4

This part is very simple: it returns the dictionary populated by the correct statement to the main program.
It's important **not to modify this part of the file**. Instead, you can copy and paste it into your own heuristic file.

Using the heuristic file
------------------------

Once you modified your heuristic file or created a new one, you can save it anywhere you want, as a python script (``somename.py``). Check that the file is **executable**! Then, you will have to call ``phys2bids`` using the ``-heur``, the ``-sub``, and optionally the ``-ses``, arguments:

.. code-block:: shell

    phys2bids -in tutorial_file.txt -indir /home/arthurdent/git/phys2bids/phys2bids/tests/data/ -chtrig 1 -ntp 158 -tr 1.2 -outdir /home/arthurdent/physio -heur /home/arthurdent/git/phys2bids/phys2bids/heuristics/heur_tutorial.py -sub 006 -ses 01

Remember to **specify the full path** to the heuristic file. A copy of the heuristic file will be saved in the site folder.

You can find more information in the `relevant tutorial section <howto.html#generating-outputs-in-bids-format>`_.
