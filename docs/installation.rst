Installation
============

Requirements
------------

``phys2bids`` requires python 3.6 or above, as well as the modules:

.. literalinclude:: ../setup.cfg
   :lines: 25-27
   :dedent: 4

Depending on the processed files, it might require the **manual installation** of extra modules.
At the moment, those modules are:

- |bioread|_, for AcqKnowledge (``.acq``) files.

.. _bioread: https://github.com/uwmadison-chm/bioread

.. |bioread| replace:: ``bioread``

Linux and mac installation
--------------------------

Install with ``pip``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
    The following instructions are provided assuming that python 3 is **not** your default version of python.
    If it is, you might need to use ``pip`` instead of ``pip3``, although some OSs do adopt ``pip3`` anyway.
    If you want to check, type ``python --version`` in a terminal.

Install ``phys2bids`` alone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pypi has the latest stable release of ``phys2bids`` as a package. Since we use ``auto`` to publish the latest features as soon as they are ready, it will *really* be the latest release. Just run::

    pip3 install phys2bids

Install extra modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are planning to use file formats other than plain ``txt``, you need to install extra modules to have the right interface.
Extra modules installation can be done with the syntax::

    pip3 install phys2bids[<extra>]

Where ``<extra>`` is one of the following:

    - ``acq``: if you plan to use native AcqKnowledge files (``.acq`` extension)
    - ``interfaces``: for all the interfaces above.

For instance, if you plan to install ``phys2bids`` and use all of the interfaces, run::

    pip3 install phys2bids[interfaces]

.. note::
    If you "missed" or skipped this trick when you installed ``phys2bids`` the first time, don't worry!
    You can do it any time - this will update ``phys2bids`` and install all extra modules you want. 


Install without ``pip``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the latest package release from `github <https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids>`_ and uncompress it.
Alternatively, if you have ``git`` installed, use the command::

    git clone https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids.git

Open a terminal in the ``phys2bids`` folder and execute the command::

    python3 setup.py

You might still need to install extra dependencies listed at the beginning of the page.

.. note::
    If python 3 is already your default, you might use ``python`` rather than ``python3``

Check your installation!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Type the command::

    phys2bids -v

If your output is: ``phys2bids 2.2.2`` or similar, ``phys2bids`` is ready to be used.

Windows installation
--------------------

First of all let's check you have python installed. Open a windows power shell window in **admin mode** and type::

    python --version

In case you don't have it, either install it from `here <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-38/9mssztt1n39l?activetab=pivot:overviewtab>`_ or type the command::

    python

It will redirect you to the windows store python install (in the creation of this tutorial the newest version of python was 3.8).

.. warning::
    ``phys2bids`` supports Python 3.6 and later versions. We can't guarantee it will work if you use python 2.

Once python is installed, you can follow the instructions to install ``phys2bids`` reported `above <#install-with-pip>`_

.. note::
    Remember to open a terminal in **admin mode** to install libraries!
