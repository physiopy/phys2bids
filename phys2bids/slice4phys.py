def find_runs(phys_in, ntp_list, tr_list, thr=None, padding=9):
    """
    Find runs slicing index.

    Returns dictionary key for each run in BlueprintInput object based on
    user's entries. Each key has a tuple of 4 elements, 2 expressing the
    timestamps of run in nb of samples. Timestamps are the index of first and
    last triggers of a run, adjusted with padding. run_start and run_end
    indexes refer to the samples contained in the whole session.
    First trigger time offset and nb of triggers contained in the run are also indicated.

    Parameters
    ---------
    phys_in: BlueprintInput object
        Object returned by BlueprintInput class
    ntp_list: list
        a list of integers given by the user as `ntp` input
    tr_list: list
        a list of float given by the user as `tr` input
    thr: int
        inherit threshold for detection of trigger given by user
    padding: int
        extra time at beginning and end of timeseries, expressed in seconds (s)
        Default: 9

    Returns
    --------
    run_timestamps: dictionary
        Containing tuples of run start and end indexes for each run, based on
        trigger channels. It also contains run attributes: time offset from
        session beggining, and nb of triggers in the form of
        run_timestamps{1:(start, end, time offset, nb of triggers),
